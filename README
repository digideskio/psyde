Herein are contained the scripts that I use nowadays to publish my blog.
I want to evolve them towards a tool that people can download and use, not
just for blogs, but for any static webpage. My goal is to make it a port
of Haskell's Hakyll.

Right now, things are in a bit of a jumble in this repository. They are
fairly tied to my particular blog, because so far I've been focusing on
getting something working rather than making things orthogonal from the
beginning.

My immediate plans include adding a comment system to the blog. After that,
I'll start teasing the specifics and the generalistics apart.
